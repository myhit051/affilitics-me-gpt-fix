# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Facebook API integration to the affiliate marketing dashboard, providing users with the option to connect their Facebook advertising accounts directly through OAuth authentication instead of manually importing data files. The integration will enable real-time data synchronization, automated campaign tracking, and seamless access to Facebook advertising metrics within the existing dashboard interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a marketing professional, I want to choose between importing Facebook data via file upload or connecting directly through Facebook API, so that I can select the most convenient method for my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the data import section THEN the system SHALL display both "Import File" and "Connect Facebook API" options
2. WHEN a user selects "Connect Facebook API" THEN the system SHALL initiate the OAuth authentication flow
3. IF a user has already connected their Facebook account THEN the system SHALL display the connection status and allow disconnection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with Facebook through a secure OAuth flow, so that I can grant the application access to my advertising data without sharing my credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Facebook API" THEN the system SHALL open a popup window with Facebook's OAuth login page
2. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with Facebook THEN the system SHALL receive an authorization code
3. WHEN the authorization code is received THEN the system SHALL exchange it for an access token automatically
4. IF the OAuth flow is cancelled or fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely and close the popup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically fetch my Facebook advertising data using the API, so that I don't need to manually export and import files regularly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Facebook account is connected THEN the system SHALL fetch available ad accounts associated with the user
2. WHEN ad accounts are retrieved THEN the system SHALL allow users to select which accounts to sync
3. WHEN accounts are selected THEN the system SHALL fetch campaign data, ad performance metrics, and spend information
4. IF API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data is successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL integrate it with the existing dashboard components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my Facebook API connection settings, so that I can control data synchronization and revoke access when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses connection settings THEN the system SHALL display current connection status and permissions
2. WHEN a user wants to disconnect THEN the system SHALL revoke the access token and clear stored credentials
3. WHEN a user wants to refresh the connection THEN the system SHALL re-initiate the OAuth flow
4. IF the access token expires THEN the system SHALL attempt to refresh it automatically using the refresh token
5. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Facebook API data to integrate seamlessly with existing dashboard features, so that I can analyze Facebook campaigns alongside other data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Facebook data is imported via API THEN the system SHALL format it to match the existing data structure
2. WHEN Facebook campaigns are loaded THEN they SHALL appear in the campaign table with proper platform identification
3. WHEN filtering by platform THEN Facebook campaigns SHALL be included in the filter options
4. WHEN generating reports THEN Facebook API data SHALL be included in ROI calculations and performance metrics
5. IF both file import and API data exist THEN the system SHALL handle data merging without duplication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want automatic data synchronization from Facebook API, so that my dashboard always shows current campaign performance without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Facebook connection is active THEN the system SHALL sync data automatically at configurable intervals
2. WHEN new campaigns are created in Facebook THEN they SHALL appear in the dashboard after the next sync
3. WHEN campaign performance changes THEN the dashboard SHALL reflect updated metrics
4. IF sync fails due to API errors THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry according to configured policy
5. WHEN sync is successful THEN the system SHALL update the last sync timestamp and data freshness indicators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging for Facebook API integration, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including error codes and messages
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear user-friendly error messages
3. IF API quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display appropriate warnings and suggest retry timing
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper retry mechanisms with circuit breaker patterns
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to file import functionality
